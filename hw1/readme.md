**Here are the shell scripts for hw1.**

**And for the 3rd question, I will return a csv file called summary_zwf.csv.**


#*In ex1*
I need to change the file names.
<p>
I use for loop and mv to change the name of out and log file.
And the name for shell scripts is normalizeFileNames.sh.

#*In ex2*
I need to use grep function to get information from log files by for loop.
And followed the professors suggestions, I rewrite the shell file into summarizeSNaQres_ex2.sh
<p>
The information I need to find:
<p>
* "analysis": the file name root
- "h": number after hmax
- "CPUtime": number after "Elapsed time"

#*In ex3*
I use sed to get mroe information in log files.
