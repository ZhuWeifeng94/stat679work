Here are the shell scripts for hw1.

And for the 2nd question, I will return a csv file called summaryzwf.csv.

Actually, I have also update the .csv file that I got.

This time I update the summary shell for ex3, and also returns a csv file.

In ex1, I use for loop and mv to change the name of out and log file.
And the name for shell scripts is normalizeFileNames.sh.

In ex2, I use grep function to get information from log files by for loop.
And followed the professors suggestions, I rewrite the shell file into summarizeSNaQres_ex2.sh

In ex3, I use sed to get mroe information in log files.
